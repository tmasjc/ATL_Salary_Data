Atlanta City Employee Salaries 2015
================

## Overview

This [Shiny app](https://tmasjc.shinyapps.io/atl_salary_data/) explores
the Atlanta city employee salaries data for the Year 2015. In
particular, the relationship between employee `salary` and variables
such as `gender`, `age`, and `ethnic group`.

Dataset obtained from
[data.world](https://data.world/brentbrewington/atlanta-city-employee-salaries),
contributed by [Brent
Brewington](https://github.com/bbrewington/atlanta-salary-data).

## Components

  - **Selector Panel** which allows user to select points using cursor
    (click-and-drag)
  - **Plot I** displays the relationship of employee `median salary` by
    `age`, seperated by `gender`
  - **Plot II** displays the relationship of employee `median salary` by
    `ethnic group`, seperated by `gender`
  - **Table I** which tabulates count at each combination of `ethnic
    group` and `gender`

## Motivation

This Shiny app is meant as a simple demonstration of how unbalanced
dataset can be misleading at times. In statistics, this phenomenon is
known as **[Simpson’s
paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)** or the
Yule–Simpson effect.

If we look at male and female `median salary` at various `age group`, we
might observe that *in general, male earns higher pay than female*.

However, if we look at male and female `median salary` by `ethnic
groups`, we notice that female’s median salary does not seem to lag
behind. As a matter of fact, *both Asian and White women median salary
is actually higher than men by an obvious margin*.

Tinker around the Shiny app to explore the data and understand the logic
behind.
